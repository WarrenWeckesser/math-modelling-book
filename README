This directory contains the files for the book
"Interdisciplinary Mathematical Modeling" that I am writing.

To create the Latex versions of the listings of the sample
code given in the appendix, run the shell script make_listings.

Subdirectory pplane_plots:
   This directory contains .eps files that were created with
   PPLANE. I do not have a script to recreate these.  Eventually

Subdirectory matlab_map1d:
   Run matlab, and give the commands:
   >> make_all_plots


Subdirectory matlab:
