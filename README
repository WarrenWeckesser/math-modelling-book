This directory contains the files for the book
"Interdisciplinary Mathematical Modeling" that I am writing.

To create the Latex versions of the listings of the sample
code given in the appendix, run the shell script make_listings.

Subdirectory pplane_plots:
   This directory contains .eps files that were created with
   PPLANE. I do not have a script to recreate these.  Eventually
   I'll create some MATLAB scripts to create new versions of
   these plots.

Subdirectory scilab:
   Run scilab and give the command
   -->exec('SIRscript.sce')
   This creates "SIR.eps"

Subdirectory matlab_map1d:
   Run matlab, and give the command:
   >> make_all_plots

Subdirectory matlab:
   Run matlab, and give the commands:
   >> SIRscript
   creates "SIRscript.plot.eps"
   >> logistic_plots
   creates "logistic_percapita_growthrate.eps",
           "logistic_growthrate.eps",
           "logistic_solutions.eps"
   >> LinPhPortExample1
   creates "LinPhPortExample1.eps"
   >> LinPhPortExample2
   creates "LinPhPortExample2.eps"
   >> LinPhPortExample3
   creates "LinPhPortExample3.eps"
