This directory contains the files for the book
"Interdisciplinary Mathematical Modeling" that I
am writing.

To create the Latex versions of the listings of
the sample code given in the appendix, run
the shell script make_listings.

To create all the plots:

Subdirectory scilab
   Run scilab:
   -->exec('SIRscript.sce')
   This creates "SIR.eps"
