\chapter*{Foreword}
\textbf{Rough notes for now...}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goals: (i) Convert a description of a dynamical process
into a set of mathematical equations.
(ii) Use an appropriate combination of analysis and computer
simulation to study the mathematical model.
\item  I have intentionally minimized the
number of examples from physics.
One goal of this book is
to promote the use of mathematical models in fields outside of the
physical sciences.
\item The emphasis of the modeling is dynamic processes.
The mathematical topics are differential equations, discrete maps,
and Markov Chains (which are, in fact, linear maps).
Optimization, linear programming and other related topics
are \emph{not} covered in this book.
Another vital area of applied mathematics that is not
covered here is statistics.
\item Prerequisite for the book include calculus (single variable)
and basic linear algebra.  The essential facts from linear algebra that
are needed in this book are summarized in an appendix.
\item A brief introduction to probability is given in the
first section of the chapter on Markov chains. This section
can be skipped if the students have already had a course
on basic probability.
\end{itemize}
