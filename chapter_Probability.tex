\chapter{A Brief Introduction to Probability}

\emph{``The most important questions in life are, for the 
       most part, really only problems of probability.''}


\hfill            -- Pierre Simon de La Place

Laplace also said \emph{``The theory of probabilities is at bottom nothing but common sense 
      reduced to calculus.''}

  \Pr(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is non-negative integer.
